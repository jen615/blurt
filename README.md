# Blurt
## CS50W Network Project

Blurt is a minimal Twitter-style social media platform that allows users to create accounts,
post "blurts" (short text posts) and interact with other users and their blurts. It 
includes many features common in modern social media platforms such as:

- liking/ unliking posts
- editing posts
- deleting posts
- following/ unfollowing users

and displays familiarity with technical concepts like:

- the *fetch* API
- pagination
- API development
- serialization
- server/ client side validation
- UI development
